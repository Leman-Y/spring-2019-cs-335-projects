# A Sample Makefile
# If you wish to use a Makefile in your project, you will most likely
# need to edit this one. 
# For example, if you do not have a file named utilities.h or one
# named utilities.cpp, just remove them from this Makefile.
# If you use a file named dsexceptions.h, as the book does, and avl.cpp
# depends on it, then add its name to the line for avl.o below.
